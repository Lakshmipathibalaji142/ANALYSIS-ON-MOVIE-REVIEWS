Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a text classification model using machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to classify textual data into predefined categories. The project involves several key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Text data is processed using techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization to convert it into a format suitable for model training. This step also includes encoding categorical labels to numerical values.

2. Model Training: The Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is employed to train the classification model. This model is particularly well-suited for text data and is implemented within a Scikit-learn pipeline for efficiency.

3. Model Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports. Cross-validation is also performed to ensure the model's robustness across different data splits.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV is used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, optimizing its performance.

5. Visualization: The project includes visualizations of the results using Seaborn and Matplotlib, providing insights into model accuracy and classification performance.

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed for text classification, suitable for applications like spam detection, sentiment analysis, or categorizing news articles.
